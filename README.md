This Tableau classwork project "Global Health Insights” presents a multi-dimensional view of global health indicators in 2008, focusing on life expectancy, population demographics, and related factors across continents. It combines bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and trend lines to provide a holistic understanding of health outcomes and demographic patterns.

## Here are the Visualisation related to life expectancy and population metrics of the "Global Health Insights” 

1. Life Expectancy by Continent

Europe leads with the highest average life expectancy at 77.42 years, followed by Americas (73.44), Oceania (71.44), and Asia (71.39).
Africa has the lowest life expectancy at 58.73 years, indicating significant health disparities.


2. Average Continent Growth

Range growth from 2008 to 2008 shows:

Africa with the highest growth rate (~2.5 units), followed by Asia and Americas.
Europe and Oceania exhibit minimal growth, suggesting aging populations and lower birth rates.

3. Population by Gender

Gender distribution is nearly balanced:
Male: ~49.48%
Female: ~50.52%
This indicates no major gender imbalance globally.


4. Life Expectancy vs BMI

<img width="1442" height="725" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca4e8f9f-29b1-4e2f-83f6-e53f5d4d58e9" />

Scatter plot suggests a positive correlation between BMI and life expectancy up to a point, after which the trend stabilizes.
Countries cluster around BMI values of 20–30, aligning with healthy ranges.

5. Life Expectancy Trend

6. <img width="1450" height="711" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a0c981d-89d7-49d7-96fd-b3f5272b827e" />


From 1990 to 2008, global life expectancy shows a steady upward trend, reaching close to 80 years.
This reflects improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living standards globally.


Key Insights

Regional Disparities: Africa lags significantly in life expectancy, highlighting urgent need for healthcare interventions.
Demographic Stability: Gender ratio remains balanced, reducing concerns of demographic skew.
Health Correlation: BMI and life expectancy relationship suggests lifestyle factors play a role in longevity.
Positive Global Trend: Continuous improvement in life expectancy indicates progress in global health policies.
